\begin{frame}{Type Confusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Type Confusion, CWE-843, is a class of vulnerability almost entirely unique to dynamically typed languages such as JavaScript.
        \item A highly exploitable vulnerability class, type confusions almost always lead to remote code execution within the browser sandbox.
        \item They occur as a result of accessing one JS object as if it were another. In V8, object access is determined by its \href{https://v8.dev/docs/hidden-classes}{\color{pink}HiddenClass}.
    \end{itemize}

    \end{center}
    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Type Confusion is a child of CWE-704, ``Improper Type Conversion or Cast"
            \item It is almost like halfway between a logical bug and a memory corruption bug. 
            \item Many bugs, despite not being type confusions, are said to be type confusions in Chrome's security bulletin. 
            \item There are many reasons why a type confusion may occur, but typically they occur due to incorrect graphs in Turbofan.
            \item A HiddenClass is also called a Map, but this has nothing to do with the JavaScript Map() class. 
        \end{itemize}
    }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TheHole}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item TheHole is an internal memory sentinel used by the V8 Engine to represent out-of-bounds, uninitialized, or undefined values.
        \item Before Chrome 114, leaking TheHole into the JavaScript runtime was an extreme security risk. Nowadays, it would require a second vulnerability to fully exploit.

            \label{fig:donut}
        \end{figure}
    \end{itemize}
    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item TheHole is exploitable for most of Chrome's existance, although the exploit pattern changes over time.
            \item The Chrome Developers didn't realize leaking TheHole was a security issue until Chrome 95 (2021).
            \item TheHole introduced an entire era of Chrome exploitation, lasting about two years (late 2021-2023).
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Insufficient Checks in Turbofan in ``Array.at" -- BUG 1377775}{V8 Security Team -- Filed by Samuel ``saelo" Gro$\beta$}
    \begin{columns}
        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This bug runs the built-in function Array.at many times.
                \item Turbofan optimizes the code to expect these objects by inlining the function call to this built-in. 
                \item However, Turbofan only checks the kind of Elements, not the HiddenClass of the objects themselves. 
                \item This leads to a type confusion with ``array" and ``not\_array". 
            \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This bug is an example of a type confusion. 
            \item The variable ``not\_array", is identified by the engine as a JSObject. While ``array" has the type JSArray.
            \item Both variables have the same kind of elements, ``HOLEY\_ELEMENTS", meaning some members of their array-like backing are undefined. (For example array[1]).
            \item Array.at performs a lookup in the array at index ``i". Turbofan sees this and determine that it doesn't need to make the function call to Array.at for the ``bug" function. It can just do the lookup provided the types are correct.
            \item In reality, what TurboFan should do is bailout and deoptimize the ``bug" function if it is called with exactly the wrong object type. 
            \item This bug was found quite quickly with automated testing and by fuzzing.

\begin{frame}{Json.stringify Leaks TheHole Value, leading to RCE -- CVE-2021-38003}{Exploited in the wild by Variston -- Filed by Samuel ``saelo" Gro$\beta$ and Clement Lecigne of Google TAG}
    \begin{columns}
        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Likely the most canonical vulnerability in the history of Chrome, this bug was the first example of an exploit using TheHole. 
                \item The exploit was developed by Variston, a commercial spyware vendor in Barcelona. 
                \item JSON.stringify attempts to serialize a large value, but will ultimately generate an exception. V8 improperly handles the exception, causing an uninitialized value (AKA TheHole) to be returned.

    \href{https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40057710}{\color{pink}crbug-40057710}
    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item TheHole becomes leaked back into javascript objects most often by out-of-bounds reads. (e.g. bounds-check elimination).
            \item TheHole is a bit like a stack canary or a heap trailer, which are also memory sentinels. 
            \item Prior to Chrome 114, TheHole had an ``OddballType" in the V8 engine. It shared this value with booleans and a few other built-in types.
            \item Notably, this allowed functions like toNumber() to be called on TheHole, which is very not good.
            \item Additionally, because of its use as a memory sentinel, other parts of engines were extremely not good at working with it.
            \item Nowadays, TheHole as a dedicated type. And trying to use it in any way causes V8 to halt and catch fire.
