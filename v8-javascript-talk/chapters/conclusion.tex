    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I worked on Chrome V8 primarily from September 2022 to September 2023.
            \item During this time, I was primarily focused on triaging N-days and the level of sophistication an attacker might need to weaponize the N-days before and after their embargo (90-days).
            \item This slide deck was made independently in my own time.
            \item Pretty much every component of Chrome and Chromium is open-source. An attacker with enough logistics and funding can easily
            perform patch-gap analysis for most bugs affecting the stable branch. 
            \item Financially-motivated actors tend to stay away from Chrome, it's simply not as profitable as social engineering.
        \end{itemize}
